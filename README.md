## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I reinforced my CSS basics and went a little bit deeper. This time, I learnt how to use the CSS grid on a basic level and how to create basic responsive designs.

### Continued development

I will focus on CSS layout techniques in future projects as layout was especially tricky for me as a beginner. Besides that, I should also focus on creating responsive designs. This aspect was especially difficult for me in this project, so I expect to work on this as well in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)) - It has a very thorough CSS documentation, which proved to be very useful when researching how to solve the styling problems of the project.
